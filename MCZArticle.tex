\section{}
Strategies for urban heat mitigation often make broad and non-specific recommendations (i.e. plant more trees) without accounting for local context. As a result, resources might be allocated to areas of lesser need over those where more urgent interventions are needed. Also, these interventions might return less than optimal results if local conditions are not considered. This project aims to assist with these interventions by providing a method to examine the urban heat profile of a city through an automated systematic approach. Using urban morphology information from databases such as WUDAPT and Geoscape, areas of cities are clustered using a self organising map into distinct micro climate zones (MCZs) and modelled at a micro-scale using localised features and properties. This bottom up modelling approach, using the VTUF-3D, UMEP, and TARGET models, allows these areas to be assessed in detail for their human thermal comfort performance and provide a city-wide heat map of thermal comfort. The MCZ approach allows greater efficiency in modelling at a micro-scale, as fewer representative locations need to be modelled. It also allows mitigation scenarios to be tested and targeted for each cluster type. Case studies performed using this method for the Australian capital cities, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, and Adelaide are presented.

\section{Introduction}

%For Original Research Articles \citep{conference}, Clinical Trial Articles \citep{article}, and Technology Reports \citep{patent}, the introduction should be succinct, with no subheadings \citep{book}. For Case Reports the Introduction should include symptoms at presentation \citep{chapter}, physical exams and lab results \citep{dataset}.

Local climate zones based on clustering areas

Micro climate zones, based on clustering based on outcomes.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Scenario generation}
This study starts with Geoscape\citep{Geoscape2020} data from Public Sector Mapping Agency (PSMA) Australia. Geoscape provides 2 meter resolution land cover (road, building, grass, bare earth, etc) as well as building and tree footprints and heights (figure \ref{fig:geoscape}). Using this dataset for Melbourne, representative ranges were found for surface covers and tree and building heights and footprints. From these, 9814 model domains were created with all iterations (by 5\% increments) of fractions of trees, grass, buildings and streets, as well as average building heights (from 0 to 49 meters) and vegetation heights (from 0 to 20 meters in 0.5m increments) (figure \ref{fig:scenarios}). Domains were created of 100$\times$100m with 5m resolution grids.

\subsection{VTUF-3D}
VTUF-3D\citep{Nice2018a} was used as the micro-climate modelling tool for this study. VTUF-3D is a urban micro-climate surface energy balance model that incorporates vegetation physiological processes and shading effects. The model provides output of canyon averaged air temperature ($T_{can}$) as well as 5m resolution values for each surface of surface temperature ($T_{surf}$), mean radiant temperature ($T_{mrt}$), and universal thermal climate index ($UTCI$) (figure \ref{fig:vtufresults}). Each model run was forced by the observations of Preston in Melbourne from \cite{Coutts2007} over the days February 9-14, 2004. 

Domain mean values were calculated from the results from each scenario for 4 pm of February 11th for the parameters of $T_{can}$, $T_{surf}$, $T_{mrt}$, and $UTCI$ (all in $^{\circ}$C). The current forcing conditions at that point were downward shortwave (K$\downarrow$) of 501.7$Wm^{-2}$, downward longwave (L$\downarrow$) of 365.1$Wm^{-2}$, air temperature of 25.9$^{\circ}$C, vapour pressure of 1.16 $mb$, wind at 173$^{\circ}$ of 5.4 $ms^{-1}$ and air pressure of 995.5$mb$. Energy balance parameters for net radiation ($Q^{*}$), sensible fluxes ($Q_{h}$), ground flux ($Q_{g}$), and latent heat ($Q_{e}$) were also extracted, as well as shortwave and longwave up (K$\uparrow$ and L$\uparrow$) (all in $Wm^{-2}$) and canyon wind speed ($U_{road}$) (in $ms^{-1}$).

\section{Results}

The resulting temperatures were compared to the parameters for each domain, the surface fractions and heights as well as the resulting fluxes associated with those outcomes. For $T_{can}$ (figure \ref{fig:tcanfluxes}), the greatest variations in temperatures are seen with the street fractions, the lowest temperatures seen at 50\% road area and below and slightly higher temperatures until reaching 80\%. The other fractions show an inverse (but strong) relationship

  $T_{sfc}$ (figure \ref{fig:tsfcfluxes})
   $UTCI$ (figure \ref{fig:utcifluxes})
