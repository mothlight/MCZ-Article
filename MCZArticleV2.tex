\begin{abstract}
TODO update

Strategies for urban heat mitigation often make broad and non-specific recommendations (i.e. plant more trees) without accounting for local context. As a result, resources might be allocated to areas of lesser need over those where more urgent interventions are needed. Also, these interventions might return less than optimal results if local conditions are not considered. This project aims to assist with these interventions by providing a method to examine the urban heat profile of a city through an automated systematic approach. Using urban morphology information from databases such as WUDAPT and Geoscape, areas of cities are clustered using a self organising map into distinct micro climate zones (MCZs) and modelled at a micro-scale using localised features and properties. This bottom up modelling approach, using the VTUF-3D, UMEP, and TARGET models, allows these areas to be assessed in detail for their human thermal comfort performance and provide a city-wide heat map of thermal comfort. The MCZ approach allows greater efficiency in modelling at a micro-scale, as fewer representative locations need to be modelled. It also allows mitigation scenarios to be tested and targeted for each cluster type. Case studies performed using this method for the Australian capital cities, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, and Adelaide are presented.

\section{Introduction}
Heat in urban areas is the most dangerous natural hazard in Australia \citep{Coates2014}, with these risks falling disproportionately on the elderly and the very young \citep{Nicholls2008}. Exposure to dangerous levels of heat stress is expected to increase by a factor of 5-10 by 2080 \citep{Coffel2018}, driven by more frequent, severe, and long-lasting heatwaves \citep{IPCC2013a}. The design of cities has exasperated these risks, resulting in increased heat stress for those who live in cities \citep{Coutts2012,Martilli2020}. This design has altered urban energy balances in a number of ways \citep{Oke1982}. Anthropogenic heat from buildings and transport and reduced shading through diminishing tree canopy cover result in larger amounts of net energy at street level. Meanwhile, the conversion of vegetated to impervious surfaces and reductions of available water in cities shift the urban energy balance away from latent heat (water evaporation) towards increased sensible heat (heat that can be felt) and heat storage in urban surfaces. 

Performing human thermal comfort modelling of urban areas has many challenges. To capture all the influences of urban geometry and materials on human thermal comfort, especially the influences on mean radiant temperature \citep{Kantor2011} (a temperature that accounts for the thermal stresses on a person from both solar exposure and energy/heat radiating from nearby surfaces), modelling needs to be done at a micro-scale (that is, at a grid square or pixel resolution under 1km) and should account for the influence of vegetation and water features.

Designing mitigation strategies requires both an understanding of the processes driving excess heat (especially at a micro-climate level) and methods to identify areas of high risk in need of interventions. More importantly, being able to incorporate this knowledge into planning of future development means that new built areas can be designed as climate sensitive before the built form is locked in for decades to come. 




Urban heat is a problem.

Urban heat mitigations strategies require an understanding of the drivers.

Land cover and morphology drives the micro-climates.
  Land cover of hard impervious surfaces, vegetated surfaces, buildings. And heights of vegetation and buildings.
  
Local climate zones gather ranges of land cover and heights and other things and have been used to predict temperature outcomes.

Observations of all types are limited.

Urban morphology databases to provide detailed data allows assessments.

Modelling tools to model the impacts of different urban arrangements.

Can you predict outcomes just based on parameters?

Can you remove weather and just look at the impacts of urban form?

Dependence on satellite LST can be misleading. \citep{Coutts2016d}
Help identify hot spots

Small scale building up to large scale.

Finally can make recommendations on urban design. What are the most important factors and how do they change across parameter ranges.


%Strategies, especially those that utilise blue-green infrastructure (BGI)\cite{Norton2015,Bowler2010,Gunawardena2017,Newton2020} such as increased vegetation cover, water features, and water practices (rain gardens, misting systems, or pavement watering), are available to mitigate heat. These strategies are ideally considered during the planning of future development, before these decisions are hardened into the built form for decades to come. Benefits can also be realised by an analysis of existing areas to find problem areas and incorporating BGI through remedial redesign. Both cases are best addressed using modelling tools, but as will be detailed below, these tools are currently insufficient for this task. \textbf{This leads to two project aims. The first is to improve existing models so that they are suitable to model a full range of BGI features and their human thermal comfort benefits. The second is to integrate these models into an accessible platform to simplify the analysis and use of modelled results. This project will provide high value tools to a wide range of users including urban planners and policy makers, enabling them to analyse and redesign urban areas to maximise the cooling benefits of BGI, something that has long been out of their reach.}


%Performing human thermal comfort modelling of urban areas has many challenges. To capture all the influences of urban geometry and materials on human thermal comfort, especially the influences on mean radiant temperature\cite{Kantor2011} (a temperature that accounts for the thermal stresses on a person from both solar exposure and energy/heat radiating from nearby surfaces), modelling needs to be done at a micro-scale (that is, at a grid square or pixel resolution under 1km) and should account for the influence of vegetation and water features. However, while there are many urban models, there are few modelling options available at an appropriate scale and especially models that account for all the elements of vegetation impacts and urban hydrology or that can explicitly calculate parameters needed to calculate human thermal comfort. Some of the available urban models include ENVI-met\cite{Bruse1999}, VTUF-3D\cite{Nice2018a}, SOLWEIG/UMEP\cite{Lindberg2018}, PALM\cite{Dominik2019}, canyon air temperature (CAT)\cite{Erell2006}, and OTC3D\cite{Nazarian2018}. Other models offer lower resolution local-scaled (grid resolution greater than 1km) modelling (TARGET\cite{Broadbent2019c} and SURFEX\cite{Masson2013}) or of a single point averaged across an entire (often idealised) urban canyon (TEB\cite{Masson2002a},  TEB-Veg and TEB-Tree\cite{Lemonsu2012,Redon2020}, RayMan\cite{Matzarakis2010}/SkyHelios\cite{Matzarakis2011}, and Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT\&C)\cite{Meili2020}). Some of these models (e.g. ENVI-met, PALM) are highly spatially explicit at the cost of high computational burden (and in the case of ENVI-met high licensing costs), or high levels of configuration and software expertise (e.g. SURFEX requires modification and compilation of FORTRAN code). Others (e.g. UT\&C) rely on simplified parameterisations and an idealised representation of vegetation and urban canyons for producing a detailed time series of the energy balance at the local scale. 






\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Scenario generation}\label{sec:methodsgen}
Geoscape \citep{Geoscape2020}, data from Public Sector Mapping Agency (PSMA) Australia, provides 2 meter resolution land cover (road, building, grass, bare earth, etc) as well as building and tree footprints and heights. Representative ranges of surface covers and tree and building heights and footprints were calculated for Melbourne. From these, 9814 model domains were created with all iterations (by 5\% increments) of fractions of trees, grass, buildings and streets, as well as heights of buildings (from 0 to 49 meters) and vegetation (from 0 to 20 meters in 0.5m increments) (figure \ref{fig:scenarios}). These domains were created of 100$\times$100m with 5m resolution grids. Additionally, surface fractions and average building and vegetation heights were calculated for 100$\times$100m locations across Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth.

\end{figure*} 



\subsection{VTUF-3D}\label{sec:methodsvtuf}
VTUF-3D \citep{Nice2018a} was used as the micro-climate modelling tool for this study. VTUF-3D is a urban micro-climate surface energy balance model that incorporates vegetation physiological processes and shading effects. The model provides output of canyon averaged air temperature ($T_{can}$) as well as 5m resolution values for each surface of surface temperature ($T_{surf}$), mean radiant temperature ($T_{mrt}$), and universal thermal climate index ($UTCI$) (figure \ref{fig:vtufresults}). Each model run was forced by the observations of Preston in Melbourne from \cite{Coutts2007} over the days February 9-13, 2004. Additional scenario runs were performed for February 13-16 2004 using the same forcing data source. As temperatures reached 36\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} on February 14th, these will provide extreme heat days.

An analysis time was used of  4 pm of February 12th. The current forcing conditions at that point were downward shortwave (\gls{kdown}) of 501.7$Wm^{-2}$, downward longwave (\gls{ldown}) of 365.1$Wm^{-2}$, air temperature of 25.9\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}, vapour pressure of 1.16 $mb$, wind at 173$^{\circ}$ of 5.4 $ms^{-1}$ and air pressure of 995.5$mb$. Energy balance parameters for net radiation (\gls{qstar}), sensible fluxes (\gls{qh}), ground flux (\gls{qg}), and latent heat (\gls{qe}) were also extracted, as well as shortwave and longwave up (\gls{kup} and \gls{lup}) (all in $Wm^{-2}$) and canyon wind speed ($U_{road}$) (in $ms^{-1}$).

\subsection{Parameter analysis}\label{sec:methodsparam}

% -  temperature distributions at 0m created for each completed run
%  All surfaces at 0m for each timestep, temperatures and counts of for Tsfc, Tmrt, and UTCI.
%  Ta is single value (canyon averaged) for each domain
% - All runs are combined into single data file for each timestep
%     contains temperatures and energy fluxes

Domain mean values at ground surface level were calculated from the results from each scenario for the parameters of $T_{can}$, $T_{surf}$, $T_{mrt}$, and $UTCI$ (all in $^{\circ}$C). 

Results from the 9814 completed model runs were extracted for each hourly timestep including the values for \gls{tsfc}, \gls{tmrt}, and \gls{utci} at ground level. VTUF-3D generates a single canyon averaged air temperature (\gls{tcan}). Additionally, domain averaged energy flux values were extracted, including latent fluxes (\gls{qe}), sensible fluxes (\gls{qh}), net radiation (\gls{qstar}), ground fluxes (\gls{qg}), shortwave up (\gls{kup}), shortwave down (\gls{kdown}), longwave up (\gls{lup}), and longwave down (\gls{ldown}). Hourly results were combined and indexed by their unique parameter ranges.

A feature importance analysis was performed using the Random Forest Classifier from  scikit-learn \citep{scikit-learn}. Ranks of feature importance were determined for each temperature type (\gls{tcan}, \gls{tsfc}, \gls{tmrt}, and \gls{utci}) for the four surface fraction parameters (grass, trees, buildings, and roads) as well as average vegetation and building heights.

% plot_10percent_absolute_cycle.R
%
%  plot box per 10 % used pandas describe and groupby to find the mean temperature increases per 10 % fraction increases or 0.8m height increases.
%    These were plotted at a few specific times comparing temperature increases vs surface fractions.
%  To replace R2, a full day's data was split into panels for each surface type and the differences plotted individually for each 10 % increment.

To determine the trends of the four temperature types (\gls{tcan}, \gls{tsfc}, \gls{tmrt}, and \gls{utci}), Matplotlib \citep{Hunter2007} was used to generate box plots of modelled temperature results vs surface types (tree, grass, building, road) in 10\% ranges as well as average building and vegetation heights (in 0.4m ranges). The backgrounds of each plot were tinted in green according to the parameter's calculated level of feature importance.

%To explore the trends associated with each surface fraction type over a diurnal cycle, the $R^{2}$ of modelled temperature vs. surface fraction percentage or average building or vegetation heights was calculated for each hour for each of the six parameters and four temperature types and plotted as a line graph. 

In addition, mean temperatures were calculated for each temperature type and fraction percentages and heights using pandas \citep{reback2020pandas} describe method and groupby of 10\% increments of surface fractions or 0.4 meter average heights. Then temperature differences between increasing fractions and heights were calculated and plotted across for specific hours on 12 Feburary 2004 as well as across the entire diurnal cycle.



\subsection{Distributions of temperatures across a diurnal cycle}\label{sec:methodsdist}
%
% ridge plots, ggridge_plots.R
%   sample scenarios were selected (that represented some of the most common urban arrangments)
%   hourly distributions on Feb 12 of Tsfc, Tmrt, and UTCI (Ta is only canyon averages) using R ggplot ggridges
% 

A number of scenarios were selected that represented frequent urban morphologies found in Melbourne and hourly distributions over a diurnal cycle (of February 12th) using ggridges \citep{ggridges}. Temperatures plotted were \gls{tsfc}, \gls{tmrt}, and \gls{utci}. \gls{tcan} is a single canyon average so does not have a distribution.


\subsection{City scale heat maps from micro-climate modelled results}\label{sec:methodsheatmaps}
% city heat maps
%  the vtuf scenarios used forcing (and range of urban morphologies) from Melbourne (Preston) Coutts 2007
%  completed model results were matched back to locations across Melbourne by matching the modelled parameters 
%   of surface fractions and heights to the actual parameters of those locations.
%  resulting heat maps of Ta, Tsfc, Tmrt, and UTCI were visualised in QGIS.
%  Tsfc results were compared to CSIRO LST maps generated by \citep{Devereux2017} and visialised in QGIS.
%  In addition, model results were matched to locations in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, and Adelaide to generate heatmaps
%  Correlations between differences and surface fractions 
%  /home/kerryn/git/2020-07-Frontiers-UrbClimInformatics/Analysis/Figures/GISMap
%  correlations.R

City-wide heat maps of \gls{tcan}, \gls{tsfc}, \gls{tmrt}, and \gls{utci} were generated from the 9814 modelled scenario results. Each model run was forced by the observations of Preston in Melbourne from \cite{Coutts2007} over the days February 9-14, 2004. The actual urban morphology parameters calculated from the Geoscape data were matched to the modelled scenario with the closest matching parameters of surface fractions and average heights for each 100$\times$100m location in Melbourne and visualized in QGIS \citep{QGIS2009}. Locations with greater than 10\% surface fraction of water were removed from the results as VTUF-3D does not currently model water bodies.

These resulting heatmaps show a city-wide assessment of thermal performance due to urban form but is independent of local weather conditions (i.e. ocean breezes vs. calm inland conditions). In addition, the same modelled results were matched to locations across Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, and Adelaide to generate city-wide urban form heatmaps for each of these cities.  \gls{tsfc} heatmap results were compared to the land surface temperature maps of \cite{Devereux2017}, which were generated from multiple aggregated Landsat 8 land surface temperature imagery over 2015-2016. Results were visialised in QGIS. TODO update, now using Landsat 8 LST maps from days with similar weather conditions and clear skies.
