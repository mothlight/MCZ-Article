\begin{abstract}
TODO update

Strategies for urban heat mitigation often make broad and non-specific recommendations (i.e. plant more trees) without accounting for local context. As a result, resources might be allocated to areas of lesser need over those where more urgent interventions are needed. Also, these interventions might return less than optimal results if local conditions are not considered. This project aims to assist with these interventions by providing a method to examine the urban heat profile of a city through an automated systematic approach. Using urban morphology information from databases such as WUDAPT and Geoscape, areas of cities are clustered using a self organising map into distinct micro climate zones (MCZs) and modelled at a micro-scale using localised features and properties. This bottom up modelling approach, using the VTUF-3D, UMEP, and TARGET models, allows these areas to be assessed in detail for their human thermal comfort performance and provide a city-wide heat map of thermal comfort. The MCZ approach allows greater efficiency in modelling at a micro-scale, as fewer representative locations need to be modelled. It also allows mitigation scenarios to be tested and targeted for each cluster type. Case studies performed using this method for the Australian capital cities, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, and Adelaide are presented.

\section{Introduction}
Heat in urban areas is the most dangerous natural hazard in Australia \citep{Coates2014}, with these risks falling disproportionately on the elderly and the very young \citep{Nicholls2008}. Exposure to dangerous levels of heat stress is expected to increase by a factor of 5-10 by 2080 \citep{Coffel2018}, driven by more frequent, severe, and long-lasting heatwaves \citep{IPCC2013a}. The design of cities has exasperated these risks, resulting in increased heat stress for those who live in cities \citep{Coutts2012,Martilli2020}. This design has altered urban energy balances in a number of ways \citep{Oke1982}. Anthropogenic heat from buildings and transport and reduced shading through diminishing tree canopy cover result in larger amounts of net energy at street level. Meanwhile, the conversion of vegetated to impervious surfaces and reductions of available water in cities shift the urban energy balance away from latent heat (water evaporation) towards increased sensible heat (heat that can be felt) and heat storage in urban surfaces. 

Designing mitigation strategies requires both an understanding of the processes driving excess heat (especially at a micro-climate level) and methods to identify areas of high risk in need of interventions. More importantly, being able to incorporate this knowledge into planning of future development means that new built areas can be designed as climate sensitive before the built form is locked in for decades to come. 

Remote sensed land surface temperature (LST) has often been used to identify hotspots \citep{Aniello1995} or to evaluate cooling strategies \citep{Zhu2012a,Duncan2018,Manoli2019,Ossola2021}, however the validity of these results and the ability to link LST temperatures (measured at the top of the urban canopy) to thermal comfort at ground level can be limited and misleading  \citep{Coutts2016d}. As the shading provided by the urban canopy (both vegetation and urban structures) is a significant cooling mechanism \citep{Coutts2015,Lee2018,Krayenhoff2021}, these effects will not be captured in an above canopy assessment. However, obtaining under canopy observations of these heterogeneous environments is challenging, time consuming and limited in scale and resolution and to the observation time period \citep{Middel2019a}. In addition, the challenge of untangling the local weather conditions from the influence of the urban form remains \citep{Potgieter2021}.

Modelling can be of use in assessing the thermal impacts of the ranges of urban arrangements and compositions. However, this also presents challenges. City-wide modelling at a micro-scale requires large investments in computational power as well as extensive high resolution data sources of urban form (land cover and building and vegetation heights and footprints). 

A number of efforts are under way to assemble these datasets. The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project \citep{Ching2018a} has been building an open data world-wide database of urban parameters necessary for climate modelling. Initial efforts have focused on building local climate zones (LCZ) \citep{Stewart2012b}, a standardised classification system to describe urban morphology typologies, providing local-scaled resolution coverage of wide areas of the world \citep{Demuzere2019}. While these initial efforts are not of sufficient resolution to support micro-scaled modelling, a pathway for higher resolution databases has been planned \citep{Ching2019}. Other sources of urban information are becoming available, such as the commercial provider Geoscape \citep{Geoscape2020} which provides 2m resolution land cover coverage of major Australian cities, as well as building and tree heights and footprints. However, currently there does not exist an open dataset with world-wide coverage at a scale sufficient for micro-scaled modelling.

Performing human thermal comfort modelling of urban areas has many challenges. To capture all the influences of urban geometry and materials on human thermal comfort, especially the influences on mean radiant temperature \citep{Kantor2011} (a temperature that accounts for the thermal stresses on a person from both solar exposure and energy/heat radiating from nearby surfaces), modelling needs to be done at a micro-scale (that is, at a grid square or pixel resolution under 1km) and should account for the influence of vegetation and water features. However, while there are many urban models, there are few modelling options available at an appropriate scale and especially models that account for all the elements of vegetation impacts and urban hydrology or that can explicitly calculate parameters needed to calculate human thermal comfort. Some of the available urban models include ENVI-met \citep{Bruse1999}, VTUF-3D \citep{Nice2018a}, SOLWEIG/UMEP \citep{Lindberg2018}, PALM \citep{Dominik2019}, canyon air temperature (CAT) \citep{Erell2006}, and OTC3D \citep{Nazarian2018}. For this study, VTUF-3D will be used. Previous efforts have utilised LCZs to provide the urban form input for climate modelling of specific areas \citep{stewart2014eval,Verdonck2018,Hammerberg2018,Masson2020,Emery2021}. However, this study will generate a full range of possible urban form mixes and then match the appropriate results back to each individual location as determined by its individual mix as determined by the high resolution Geoscape data across each city. 

The aim of this study is therefore to devise a method to determine the influence of urban form on thermal comfort utilising a urban morphology data source and micro-climate modelling and apply it at a city-wide scale to allow identification of areas that could benefit from heat mitigation interventions as well as inform planning and development of new climate sensitive urban form. The first objective will be to model at a micro-scale the full range of representative combinations of urban form (mixes of land cover and urban and vegetative structure). The second objective will be to use these results to determine the importance and relative influence of each feature type on thermal performance. The final objective will be to build the results back up to a city-wide assessment of thermal comfort due to urban form.

%Strategies, especially those that utilise blue-green infrastructure (BGI)\cite{Norton2015,Bowler2010,Gunawardena2017,Newton2020} such as increased vegetation cover, water features, and water practices (rain gardens, misting systems, or pavement watering), are available to mitigate heat. These strategies are ideally considered during the planning of future development, before these decisions are hardened into the built form for decades to come. Benefits can also be realised by an analysis of existing areas to find problem areas and incorporating BGI through remedial redesign. Both cases are best addressed using modelling tools, but as will be detailed below, these tools are currently insufficient for this task. \textbf{This leads to two project aims. The first is to improve existing models so that they are suitable to model a full range of BGI features and their human thermal comfort benefits. The second is to integrate these models into an accessible platform to simplify the analysis and use of modelled results. This project will provide high value tools to a wide range of users including urban planners and policy makers, enabling them to analyse and redesign urban areas to maximise the cooling benefits of BGI, something that has long been out of their reach.}


%Performing human thermal comfort modelling of urban areas has many challenges. To capture all the influences of urban geometry and materials on human thermal comfort, especially the influences on mean radiant temperature\cite{Kantor2011} (a temperature that accounts for the thermal stresses on a person from both solar exposure and energy/heat radiating from nearby surfaces), modelling needs to be done at a micro-scale (that is, at a grid square or pixel resolution under 1km) and should account for the influence of vegetation and water features.

Other models offer lower resolution local-scaled (grid resolution greater than 1km) modelling (TARGET\cite{Broadbent2019c} and SURFEX\cite{Masson2013}) or of a single point averaged across an entire (often idealised) urban canyon (TEB\cite{Masson2002a},  TEB-Veg and TEB-Tree\cite{Lemonsu2012,Redon2020}, RayMan\cite{Matzarakis2010}/SkyHelios\cite{Matzarakis2011}, and Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT\&C)\cite{Meili2020}). Some of these models (e.g. ENVI-met, PALM) are highly spatially explicit at the cost of high computational burden (and in the case of ENVI-met high licensing costs), or high levels of configuration and software expertise (e.g. SURFEX requires modification and compilation of FORTRAN code). Others (e.g. UT\&C) rely on simplified parameterisations and an idealised representation of vegetation and urban canyons for producing a detailed time series of the energy balance at the local scale. 






\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Scenario generation}\label{sec:methodsgen}
Geoscape \citep{Geoscape2020}, data from Public Sector Mapping Agency (PSMA) Australia, provides 2 meter resolution land cover (road, building, grass, bare earth, etc) as well as building and tree footprints and heights. Representative ranges of surface covers and tree and building heights and footprints were calculated for Melbourne. From these, 9814 model domains were created with all iterations (by 5\% increments) of fractions of trees, grass, buildings and streets, as well as heights of buildings (from 0 to 49 meters) and vegetation (from 0 to 20 meters in 0.5m increments) (Figure \ref{fig:scenarios}). These domains were created of 100$\times$100m with 5m resolution grids. Additionally, surface fractions and average building and vegetation heights were calculated for 100$\times$100m locations across Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth.

 \label{fig:scenarios}
\end{figure*} 



\subsection{VTUF-3D}\label{sec:methodsvtuf}
VTUF-3D \citep{Nice2018a} was used as the micro-climate modelling tool for this study. VTUF-3D is a urban micro-climate surface energy balance model that incorporates vegetation physiological processes and shading effects. The model provides output of canyon averaged air temperature ($T_{can}$) as well as 5m resolution values for each surface of surface temperature ($T_{surf}$), mean radiant temperature ($T_{mrt}$), and universal thermal climate index ($UTCI$) (figure \ref{fig:vtufresults}). Each model run was forced by the observations of Preston in Melbourne from \cite{Coutts2007} over the days February 9-13, 2004. Additional scenario runs were performed for February 13-16 2004 using the same forcing data source. As temperatures reached 36\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} on February 14th, these will provide extreme heat days.

An analysis time was used of  4 pm of February 12th. The current forcing conditions at that point were downward shortwave (\gls{kdown}) of 501.7$Wm^{-2}$, downward longwave (\gls{ldown}) of 365.1$Wm^{-2}$, air temperature of 25.9\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}, vapour pressure of 1.16 $mb$, wind at 173$^{\circ}$ of 5.4 $ms^{-1}$ and air pressure of 995.5$mb$. Energy balance parameters for net radiation (\gls{qstar}), sensible fluxes (\gls{qh}), ground flux (\gls{qg}), and latent heat (\gls{qe}) were also extracted, as well as shortwave and longwave up (\gls{kup} and \gls{lup}) (all in $Wm^{-2}$) and canyon wind speed ($U_{road}$) (in $ms^{-1}$).

%  Ta is single value (canyon averaged) for each domain
% - All runs are combined into single data file for each timestep

Domain mean values at ground surface level were calculated from the results from each scenario for the parameters of $T_{can}$, $T_{surf}$, $T_{mrt}$, and $UTCI$ (all in $^{\circ}$C). 

Results from the 9814 completed model runs were extracted for each hourly timestep including the values for \gls{tsfc}, \gls{tmrt}, and \gls{utci} at ground level. VTUF-3D generates a single canyon averaged air temperature (\gls{tcan}). Additionally, domain averaged energy flux values were extracted, including latent fluxes (\gls{qe}), sensible fluxes (\gls{qh}), net radiation (\gls{qstar}), ground fluxes (\gls{qg}), shortwave up (\gls{kup}), shortwave down (\gls{kdown}), longwave up (\gls{lup}), and longwave down (\gls{ldown}). Hourly results were combined and indexed by their unique parameter ranges.

A feature importance analysis was performed using the Random Forest Classifier from  scikit-learn \citep{scikit-learn}. Ranks of feature importance were determined for each temperature type (\gls{tcan}, \gls{tsfc}, \gls{tmrt}, and \gls{utci}) for the four surface fraction parameters (grass, trees, buildings, and roads) as well as average vegetation and building heights.

%    These were plotted at a few specific times comparing temperature increases vs surface fractions.
%  To replace R2, a full day's data was split into panels for each surface type and the differences plotted individually for each 10 % increment.

To determine the trends of the four temperature types (\gls{tcan}, \gls{tsfc}, \gls{tmrt}, and \gls{utci}), Matplotlib \citep{Hunter2007} was used to generate box plots of modelled temperature results vs surface types (tree, grass, building, road) in 10\% ranges as well as average building and vegetation heights (in 0.4m ranges). The backgrounds of each plot were tinted in green according to the parameter's calculated level of feature importance.

%To explore the trends associated with each surface fraction type over a diurnal cycle, the $R^{2}$ of modelled temperature vs. surface fraction percentage or average building or vegetation heights was calculated for each hour for each of the six parameters and four temperature types and plotted as a line graph. 

In addition, mean temperatures were calculated for each temperature type and fraction percentages and heights using pandas \citep{reback2020pandas} describe method and groupby of 10\% increments of surface fractions or 0.4 meter average heights. Then temperature differences between increasing fractions and heights were calculated and plotted across for specific hours on 12 Feburary 2004 as well as across the entire diurnal cycle.

A number of scenarios were selected that represented frequent urban morphologies found in Melbourne and hourly distributions over a diurnal cycle (of February 12th) using ggridges \citep{ggridges}. Temperatures plotted were \gls{tsfc}, \gls{tmrt}, and \gls{utci}. \gls{tcan} is a single canyon average so does not have a distribution.

City-wide heat maps of \gls{tcan}, \gls{tsfc}, \gls{tmrt}, and \gls{utci} were generated from the 9814 modelled scenario results. Each model run was forced by the observations of Preston in Melbourne from \cite{Coutts2007} over the days February 9-14, 2004. The actual urban morphology parameters calculated from the Geoscape data were matched to the modelled scenario with the closest matching parameters of surface fractions and average heights for each 100$\times$100m location in Melbourne and visualized in QGIS \citep{QGIS2009}. Locations with greater than 10\% surface fraction of water were removed from the results as VTUF-3D does not currently model water bodies.

These resulting heatmaps show a city-wide assessment of thermal performance due to urban form but is independent of local weather conditions (i.e. ocean breezes vs. calm inland conditions). In addition, the same modelled results were matched to locations across Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, and Adelaide to generate city-wide urban form heatmaps for each of these cities.  \gls{tsfc} heatmap results were compared to the land surface temperature maps of \cite{Devereux2017}, which were generated from multiple aggregated Landsat 8 land surface temperature imagery over 2015-2016. Results were visialised in QGIS. TODO update, now using Landsat 8 LST maps from days with similar weather conditions and clear skies.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Temperature trends across fractions and feature importance}\label{sec:resulttrends}

The range of average results from 9814 scenarios for four temperature types (\gls{tcan}, \gls{tsfc}, \gls{tmrt}, and \gls{utci}) at varying surface fractions of grass, trees, buildings, and roads and average heights of vegetation and buildings are presented in Figures \ref{fig:box0}, \ref{fig:box5}, \ref{fig:box14} on February 12, 2004 at 12am, 5am, and 2pm respectively.


TODO, present all four temperature types or just the two below?

The range of average results from 9814 scenarios for two temperature types (\gls{tcan} and \gls{utci}) at varying surface fractions of grass, trees, buildings, and roads and average heights of vegetation and buildings are presented in Figures \ref{fig:box0a}, \ref{fig:box5a}, \ref{fig:box14a} on February 12, 2004 at 12am, 5am, and 2pm respectively.

With these results, there are a small number of scenarios with very high fractions of a surface type (80-100\%) compared to those with very small fractions, as a scenario with, as an example, 90\% grass means there are only a small number of combinations to use the remaining 10\% fractions.

During the nighttime (12am and 5am), there is a narrow range of \gls{tcan}, ranging from approximately 15.3-16.3$^{\circ}$C. Increasing fractions of trees have very little effect at 12am and slight reductions of approximately 0.1$^{\circ}$C from 0 to 100\%. Increasing vegetation height has an almost identical impact at nighttime. Increasing grass fractions has a slight warming impact of about 0.3$^{\circ}$C. Increasing building heights has an almost identical effect. Increasing building and street fractions has a mostly neural effect but at dawn (5am), the increasing street fractions start to have a very slight warming impact (0.3$^{\circ}$C). 

At nighttime, trends of \gls{utci}, which include the influences of \gls{tsfc} and \gls{tmrt}, show decreases of approximately 2.5$^{\circ}$C as fractions of trees and buildings and vegetation heights increase. \gls{utci} increases are seen of approximately 3.0$^{\circ}$C as grass fractions and building heights increase and 1.5$^{\circ}$C as street fractions increase.

At 2pm, at the warmest time of the day, increasing tree and building fractions and increasing vegetation height continue to provide some \gls{tcan} temperature reductions of 1-2$^{\circ}$C. Grass fractions and building heights increases show an initial reduction towards the middle ranges then an increase at the higher ranges, with a reduction in the middle ranges of approximately 1$^{\circ}$C. Increases in street fractions however show a rapid increase in \gls{tcan} temperatures of approximately 3$^{\circ}$C as street fractions approach 80\% and another 3$^{\circ}$C at 90\%.

At 2pm, trends of \gls{utci} amplify the trends seen with \gls{tcan}. Increases in street fractions show increases of approximately 6$^{\circ}$C as street fractions approach 80\% and another 6$^{\circ}$C at 90\%. Increasing grass and building heights shows increases of 5$^{\circ}$C as fractions increase. Increasing tree and building fractions and tree heights show reductions in temperatures of approximately 5$^{\circ}$C.

Analysis of feature importance shows that building fractions and building heights are most predictive for \gls{tcan} (Figure \ref{fig:featimpttcan}a) at night while building fractions and building heights are slightly more important than grass and streets and trees and vegetation heights are of the lowest importance for \gls{utci} (Figure  \ref{fig:featimptutci}d). During the daytime, street fractions are of the highest importance for both \gls{tcan} and \gls{utci}.

In Figure \ref{fig:tcanday}, \gls{tcan} temperatures are shown for ranges of fractions and heights across the diurnal cycle of 14 February 2004. In these, small differences (1$^{\circ}$C) are seen at night-time, with larger ranges seen with street fractions and to a lesser degree with building fractions and building heights. After dawn, the differences begin to increase and reaching a peak at mid-day with maximum differences of approximately 5$^{\circ}$C with grass, tree, building fractions and building and vegetation heights. Differences at mid-day reach maximum divergences of 10 and 15$^{\circ}$C as street surface fractions reach 80 and 90\% respectively.

For \gls{utci} (Figure \ref{fig:utciday}) which include the influence of \gls{tsfc} and \gls{tmrt} (Figures \ref{fig:tmrtday} and \ref{fig:tsfcday}), the night-time ranges show wider differences, with all fractions and heights showing a difference of 2-3$^{\circ}$C between the lowest and highest amounts of fractions and heights. These difference remain roughly similar through dawn and until about 8am. Street fractions are the exception and shows even wider divergences (5$^{\circ}$C and more) starting at 6am. After 6am, differences widen to 5$^{\circ}$C for building fractions and building heights and 10$^{\circ}$C for tree and grass fractions and vegetation heights. Meanwhile, differences for street fractions grow to nearly 15$^{\circ}$C for 80\% and over 20$^{\circ}$C for 90\%.

\subsection{Distributions of temperatures across a diurnal cycle}\label{sec:resultsdist}
TODO, is this more discussion than results?

Figures \ref{fig:dist1} through \ref{fig:dist7} show the \gls{tsfc} distributions for a number of selected scenarios across the day 12 February 2004. The preceding results (Figures \ref{fig:box0}-\ref{fig:utciday}) are based on mean values, averaged across the ground level results across each domain. However, different mixes of surface fractions and average heights result in different distributions of temperatures (all in $^{\circ}$C). Figures \ref{fig:dist1}, \ref{fig:dist3}, and \ref{fig:dist5} present scenarios with very low fractions of roads and buildings and as a result show \gls{tsfc} temperatures mostly clustered in the lower ranges across day and night and very few locations that exceed the mid 20s during the day. As the fractions of road and buildings increase, especially in Figure \ref{fig:dist4}, where road and building fractions are 30 and 40\% respectively, the distributions shift strongly during the day away from locations with surface temperatures in the mid 20s to many more locations with surface temperatures in the 40s and even 50s and above.

\subsection{City scale heat maps from micro-climate modelled results}\label{sec:resultsheatmaps}

TODO, double check that is 4pm not 2pm

Figure \ref{fig:TaMelb}a and \ref{fig:TsfcMelb}b shows city-wide heat maps of \gls{tcan} and \gls{tsfc} in Melbourne at 2pm on February 12, 2004 constructed by matching the closest matching parameters for each locations from the 9814 modelled scenario results. A narrow range of air temperatures are seen across most of the city, closely aligned to the model forcing temperature of 25.9\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}. Higher temperatures can be seen in areas corresponding to higher fractions of roads and to a lesser degree of buildings. No particular reductions of air temperatures are seen in areas corresponding to higher levels of trees or grass surface fractions. Fractional breakdowns of surfaces across Melbourne are shown in Figure \ref{fig:melfracs}. 

Wider ranges of surface temperatures are seen across Melbourne. Some slight reductions of surface temperatures (below the forcing air temperature) are seen in areas that correspond to higher fractions of grass and of trees. However, strong increases in surface temperatures in areas with higher fractions of street surfaces, even starting at lower levels of 30\% and above.  In addition, very strong increases in surface temperatures can be seen in areas with very high street surface fractions, Melbourne Airport in the north west, the central business district (CBD) in the city centre, and Moorabbin Airport in the city south east.

Figures \ref{fig:Melb_TSFC12_85} and \ref{fig:Melb_TSFC14_85} present two comparisons of modelled \gls{tsfc} to Landsat 8 LST data. Panel a for both figures shows Landsat 8 imagery captured on cloudless days that mostly closely correspond to the modelled conditions, 10am December 11, 2018 when local conditions of air temperature on this day were minimum and maximum of 22 and 26\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} and 10am December 27, 2018 when local conditions of air temperature on this day were minimum and maximum of 15 and 39\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}. Differences in panel b for both figures shows the differences (modelled \gls{tsfc} minus LST) from \gls{tsfc} heatmaps created from modelled results at 10am on February 12, 2004 and February 14, 2004. 

Some broad differences can be seen from the modelled \gls{tsfc} results from the LST observations. Note, there are important differences between the two datasets, LST observations are captured by satellite and correspond to temperatures at the top of the urban canopy (i.e. the tops of trees and buildings) while the modelled \gls{tsfc} corresponds to ground surface temperatures and will generally be cooler as they include areas that are shaded by tree canopies and buildings. In addition, LST observations are influenced by additional factors than just the urban form including topography and localised weather conditions. In Figure \ref{fig:Melb_TSFC12_85}a, the cooler locations in the LST observations mostly include locations immediately off the coast and in the eastern fringes of Melbourne, the Dandenong Ranges which range from 500m to over 1000m in elevation, while the majority of central and inner Melbourne is under 100m in elevation. The main differences between the LST observations and the modelled results are strongly related to the surface fraction types, which a strong correlation between the differences and building and street fractions and a strong negative correlation with grass surface fractions.

Using the 9814 modelled scenario results, heat maps of \gls{tcan} and \gls{tsfc} (Figure \ref{fig:TaSyd}) were created for Sydney for February 12, 2004 at 2pm by matching the closest matching parameters, as calculated from Figure \ref{fig:sydfracs}, for each location. In Figures \ref{fig:Sydney-Landsat-LST-11-03-2019} and \ref{fig:Sydney-Landsat-LST-19-01-2018}, cloudless Landsat 8 observations from 10am March 11, 2019 (local conditions of air temperature on this day were minimum and maximum of 22 and 26\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}) and 10am 19 January 2018 (local conditions of air temperature on this day were minimum and maximum of 18 and 31\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}) are presented and compared to \gls{tsfc} heatmaps created from modelled results at 10am on February 12, 2004 and February 14, 2004. 

The results are similar to those from Melbourne. Ranges of \gls{tcan} are generally very narrow with small localised hot spots. The LST observations reflect a different topography than Melbourne with a larger influence of coastal features and a smaller range of elevations. Much of the central city is under 100m and only approaching 200m in the north east areas. The areas with higher ranges of LST are concentrated in the agricultural western regions of the city (with very high percentages of grass/low vegetation land cover fractions). Similar to Melbourne, correlations between differences between LST and \gls{tsfc} are strongly negatively correlated with grass fractions but somewhat less correlated with building and street fractions.

Using the 9814 modelled scenario results, heat maps of \gls{tcan} and \gls{tsfc} (Figure \ref{fig:TaPerth}) were created for Sydney for February 12, 2004 at 2pm by matching the closest matching parameters, as calculated from Figure \ref{fig:perthfracs}, for each location. In Figures \ref{fig:Perth_TSFC12_85} and \ref{fig:Perth_TSFC14_85}, cloudless Landsat 8 observations from 10am March 29, 2019 (local conditions of air temperature on this day were minimum and maximum of 13 and 27\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}) and 10am February 25, 2019 (local conditions of air temperature on this day were minimum and maximum of 19 and 37\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}) are presented and compared to \gls{tsfc} heatmaps created from modelled results at 10am on February 12, 2004 and February 14, 2004. 


Ranges of \gls{tcan} are generally narrow with small localised hot spots (including the Perth Airport in the center east of the city). The topography of Perth is much less varied than Melbourne and Sydney, with the majority of the city under 50m in elevation and only rising above 100m in the eastern fringes. Much of the city is influences by coastal features. Much of the city is low density residential only becoming mixed with low vegetation/grassland reserves in the southern sections of the city. Similar to Melbourne, correlations between differences between LST and \gls{tsfc} are strongly negatively correlated with grass fractions and strongly correlated with building and street fractions.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

Through systematic micro-climate modelling of the full range of surface fractions and average heights across Melbourne, the importance and relative influence of each feature type was discovered on the temperature types of \gls{tcan}, \gls{tmrt}, \gls{tsfc}, and \gls{utci}. For \gls{tcan}, at night time, there was a narrow range of temperatures, of approximately 1.0\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}. Increasing fractions of trees had limited impact at midnight and a very slight reduction (0.1\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}) at dawn. Increasing grass and building heights had a small warming impact (0.3\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}). Increasing street fractions also started to have a warming effect (0.3\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}) at dawn. Building fractions and building heights were found to be the most important feature.

During the daytime, the most important feature was the amount of streets. Street fractions of 80 and 90\% can drive \gls{tcan} increases of up to 10 and 15\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} while reductions are seen of about 5\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} when increasing grass and tree fractions from 0 to 100\%. These results help illuminate the findings of \cite{Emery2021} in their observations the influence of different LCZ classes on air temperature. They found that the LCZ classes with the warmest temperatures were those dominated by artificial, mineral, and impervious surfaces, as well as LCZ classes with vegetation were the coolest. However, they were not able to characterise the expected ranges of temperatures resulting from the different classes.


AND TSFC

\cite{Alexander2021} classified LST into four classes of building, vegetation, building height, and vegetation heights (essentially impervious vs pervious). Reduced LST approx 4C when vegetation increased from 0-5 to 95-100\% and increase 4C when building increased by the same. Vegetation height had negative correlation with LST but vegetation cover was stronger predictor. Building height had a positive correlation with LST only up to 9m but was not always found to have a strong influence on LST in some cities.

AND UTCI



what are the implications of being able to use this instead of LST. Like the LST map of Melbourne is cooler in the higher elevations. It is also the top of the canopy. But Tsfc shows ground level and includes the impacts of shading. And only shows urban form and not weather.

\cite{Broadbent2017a}
Found Tsfc over area average - during day / night\\
    concrete/asphalt 2.4C hotter  2.5 hotter\\
    trees 3 cooler  0.5 hotter\\
    building 3.1 hotter  2.4 cooler\\
    bare ground 1.1 hotter  0.2 cooler\\
    irr grass 7.7 cooler 0.6 cooler\\
    low veg 6.8 cooler 0.3 cooler\\
In air temperature, about +1C over average with urban midrise\\
                          0.5C with urban residential\\
                          +1 with natural/grass site at noon, but rapid cooling before sunset\\
    Spatial air temperature is hard to observe\\
